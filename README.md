# Yahtzee!

The classic game of Yahtzee made with react. 

## Rules

At the start of a turn, the player takes all 5 dice and rolls them. They can then roll some or all of the dice up to two more times, setting aside any dice they’d like to keep and rerolling the rest. The dice can be scored after any of the rolls, but scoring the dice ends the player’s turn. Setting dice aside after one roll does not prevent one or more of them from being rolled again on any subsequent roll if the player so chooses.

For more rules and the scoring method, please see here, https://www.dicegamedepot.com/yahtzee-rules/
